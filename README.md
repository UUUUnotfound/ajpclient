# ajpclient


When testing an java app running on tomcat on the 8009 ajp13 connector, you can create an apache proxy with mod_proxy and connect to your tomcat using that proxy.

For test and QA purposes, it is sometimes easier to send a curl like command.

This tool is to AJP13 what curl is to HTTP.
